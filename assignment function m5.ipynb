They are the placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function.\n","\n","Arguments: These are the actual values passed to a function when it's called. They are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function definition.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter\n","  print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n","\n","greet(\"John\")  # 'John' is an argument\n","\n","\n","\n","Question-3  What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","\n","\n","Answer-\n","In Python, functions can be defined and called in several ways:\n","\n","Defining Functions.\n","1. Standard function definition.\n","2. Lambda function.\n","3. Nested function.\n","\n","Calling functions\n","1. Standard function call.\n","2. keyword argument function call.\n","3. Variable number of Arguments function call.\n","4. Default Argument function call.\n","\n","\n","Question-4 What is the purpose of the 'return' statement in a Python function?\n","\n","Answer-\n","The return statement in a Python function serves two purposes:\n","\n","1. Exiting the function: When a return statement is encountered, the function immediately stops executing and returns control to the caller.\n","\n","2. Returning a value: The return statement can also be used to return a value from the function to the caller. This value can be any Python object, such as a number, string, list, or dictionary.\n","\n","\n","Question-5 What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n","Answer-\n","In Python:\n","\n","- Iterables: Are objects that can be looped through, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. They can be passed to the iter() function to create an iterator.\n","\n","- Iterators: Are objects that keep track of their position within an iterable and yield values one at a time. They are created by calling iter() on an iterable.\n","\n","\n","Question-6  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","\n","Answer-\n","In Python, a generator is a special type of function that can be used to generate a sequence of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.\n","\n","Generators are defined using a function definition with the yield keyword instead of return. When a generator is called, it returns an iterator object, which can be used to iterate over the generated values.\n","\n","Here's an example of a simple generator:\n","\n","def infinite_sequence():\n","    num = 0\n","    while True:\n","        yield num\n","        num += 1\n","\n","To use the generator, you can call it and iterate over the returned iterator object:\n","\n","seq = infinite_sequence()\n","for _ in range(10):\n","    print(next(seq))\n","\n","This will print the numbers 0 through 9.\n","\n","\n","Question-7  What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","\n","Answer-\n","\n","The advantages of using generators over regular functions in Python are:\n","\n","1. Memory Efficiency: Generators use significantly less memory, as they only store the current state of the iteration, rather than storing the entire sequence in memory.\n","\n","2. Lazy Evaluation: Generators only compute the next value when asked, which can be beneficial for computationally expensive operations or infinite sequences.\n","\n","3. Flexibility: Generators can be used to implement cooperative multitasking, allowing for efficient handling of concurrent tasks.\n","\n","4. Improved Performance: Generators can be faster than regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets, since they avoid the overhead of creating and returning a list.\n","\n","1. Easier Implementation of Infinite Sequences: Generators make it simple to implement infinite sequences, which would be impractical or impossible with regular functions.\n","\n","\n","\n","Question-8 What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","\n","Answer-\n","A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. It's typically used when a small, one-time-use function is needed.\n","\n","The general syntax of a lambda function is:\n","\n","lambda arguments: expression\n","\n","Lambda functions are often used in situations such as:\n","\n","1. Event handling: As event handlers, where a small, one-time-use function is needed.\n","2. Data processing: When working with data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, and a small, one-time-use function is needed to perform a specific operation.\n","3. Map(), filter(), and reduce() functions: As arguments to these higher-order functions, which apply a function to each item in an iterable.\n","4. One-time-use functions: When a function is only needed once, and defining a separate named function would be unnecessary.\n","\n","\n","Question-9 Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n","\n","Answer-\n","The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns a map object, which is an iterator.\n","\n","Purpose:\n","\n","The map() function is used to:\n","\n","1. Apply a transformation to each element of an iterable.\n","2. Create a new iterable with the transformed elements.\n","\n","Usage:\n","\n","The general syntax of the map() function is:\n","\n","map(function, iterable)\n","\n","Where:\n","\n","- function is the function to be applied to each element of the iterable.\n","- iterable is the iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) whose elements will be transformed.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","def square(x):\n","    return x ** 2\n","\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))\n","print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n","\n","In this example, the square() function is applied to each element of the numbers list using the map() function, and the resulting squared numbers are collected in a new list called squared_numbers.\n","\n","Note that in Python 3.x, the map() function returns an iterator, so we need to use the list() function to convert it to a list. In Python 2.x, map() returns a list directly.\n","\n","\n","Question-10 What is the difference between 'map()\", \"reduce()', and 'filter() functions in Python?\n","\n","Answer-\n","In Python, map(), reduce(), and filter() are three fundamental functions that operate on iterables. Here's a brief overview of each:\n","\n","Map()\n","\n","- Applies a given function to each item of an iterable.\n","- Returns a map object, which is an iterator.\n","- Syntax: map(function, iterable)\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n","print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n","\n","\n","Reduce()\n","\n","- Applies a given function to the first two items of an iterable, then to the result and the next item, and so on.\n","- Returns a single value, which is the result of the reduction.\n","- Syntax: reduce(function, iterable)\n","\n","Note: In Python 3.x, reduce() is moved to the functools module. You need to import it before using: from functools import reduce\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","import functools\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","product = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)\n","print(product)  # Output: 120\n","\n","\n","Filter()\n","\n","- Constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True.\n","- Returns a filter object, which is an iterator.\n","- Syntax: filter(function, iterable)\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n","print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n","\n","\n","In summary:\n","\n","- map() applies a function to each item of an iterable.\n","- reduce() applies a function to the first two items of an iterable, then to the result and the next item, and so on.\n","- filter() constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True.\n","\n","\n","Question-11 write the internal mechanism for sum operation using reduce function on this given list: [47,11,42,13];\n","\n","\n","Answer-\n","Here's the internal mechanism for the sum operation using the reduce function on the given list:\n","\n","Given list: [47, 11, 42, 13]\n","\n","Reduce function: reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [47, 11, 42, 13])\n","\n","Internal mechanism:\n","\n","1. x = 47, y = 11 => x + y = 58\n","2. x = 58, y = 42 => x + y = 100\n","3. x = 100, y = 13 => x + y = 113\n","\n","Result: 113\n","\n","Note: The lambda function lambda x, y: x + y is applied to the first two elements of the list, then to the result and the next element, and so on, until the list is exhausted.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Nfpy8xx6LygA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"1hkpHGNcQr3B"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#
