        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation: This concept binds data and methods that manipulate that data into a single unit, called a class or object. Encapsulation helps protect the data from external interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstraction: Abstraction involves showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the implementation details. This concept helps reduce complexity and improves modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The child class inherits all the fields and methods of the parent class and can also add new fields and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This can be achieved through method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) or method overriding (a child class providing a different implementation of a method already defined in its parent class).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Composition: Composition is a concept that allows objects to contain other objects or collections of objects. This enables the creation of complex objects from simpler ones, promoting reusability and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "These five key concepts form the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming and enable developers to create robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.\n",

However, this is not a strict access control mechanism, and private members can still be accessed using their mangled name (e.g., _classname__variable)."

        "Answer-\n",
        "The Diamond Problem is a well-known issue in multiple inheritance, where a class inherits conflicting attributes or methods from its parent classes. This problem arises when two classes, B and C, inherit from a common base class A, and then another class D inherits from both B and C.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an illustration of the Diamond Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "      A\n",
        "    /   \\\n",
        "   B     C\n",
        "    \\   /\n",
        "      D\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose classes B and C override a method m() from class A, and class D inherits from both B and C. When D.m() is called, which implementation of m() should be used: B's or C's?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python resolves the Diamond Problem using a technique called C3 Linearization, also known as the \"Method Resolution Order\" (MRO). The MRO is a standard for resolving the order of inheritance in the presence of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how Python's MRO resolves the Diamond Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. List the classes in the inheritance order: D, B, C, A, object.\n",
        "2. Remove any duplicate classes: D, B, C, A, object.\n",
        "3. If a class has already been visited, skip it: No changes.\n",
        "4. The resulting list is the MRO: D, B, C, A, object.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Python looks for a method or attribute in class D, it searches the classes in the MRO order. In this case, Python would look for m() in the following order:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. D (class D itself)\n",
        "2. B (class D's first parent)\n",
        "3. C (class D's second parent)\n",
        "4. A (the common base class)\n",
        "5. object (the ultimate base class)\n",
        "\n",
        "If Python finds m() in class B, it will use that implementation. If not, it will continue searching in the next classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example code snippet demonstrating Python's MRO:\n",
